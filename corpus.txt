## Introduction

Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users. They utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and respond to user input.

## Features

Chatbots offer various features that enhance user interactions. Some common features include:

1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot analyzes user input to understand its meaning and intent.
2. Natural Language Generation (NLG): The chatbot generates human-like responses to engage in conversation.
3. Context Awareness: The chatbot remembers previous interactions to maintain context and provide relevant responses.
4. Personalization: Chatbots can be customized to adapt to individual user preferences and behavior.
5. Integration: Chatbots can be integrated with other systems or platforms to provide additional functionalities.

## Techniques

Different techniques are used to develop chatbots, such as:

1. Rule-based Approach: Chatbots follow predefined rules and patterns to generate responses.
2. Machine Learning: Chatbots can be trained using machine learning algorithms to improve their conversational abilities.
3. Neural Networks: Deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, are used to build chatbots with better language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Limitations

Despite their advancements, chatbots still have limitations. Some common limitations include:

1. Contextual Understanding: Chatbots may struggle to understand complex or ambiguous queries that require contextual understanding.
2. Lack of Real-Time Learning: Chatbots often rely on pre-existing data and may not adapt to new information or rapidly changing contexts.
3. Handling Errors: Chatbots may provide incorrect or irrelevant responses if they encounter unfamiliar or ambiguous input.
4. Emotion Understanding: Chatbots may struggle to understand and respond appropriately to emotions expressed by users.
